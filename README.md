# 🤖 Adham ALI – 3D Robotics Developer Portfolio

A futuristic, animated 3D portfolio built with React, Three.js, TailwindCSS, and motion effects — crafted to showcase my engineering work in **robotics**, **simulation**, and **intelligent systems**.

![Portfolio Screenshot](https://adhamelkomi.github.io/portfolio/assets/website.png)

This portfolio was designed to showcase my engineering projects in robotics, embedded programming, simulation, and 3D design in an interactive and visually appealing way. It serves as a personal showcase to highlight my technical skills, design approach, and key experiences gained throughout my studies.

The interface offers smooth navigation within a 3D animated environment, with a dedicated section for each project. Every project page presents the context, technical contributions, technologies used, visuals (GIFs, images, videos), and sometimes external links to source code or demonstrations.

It features a variety of work ranging from autonomous robot programming with ROS, to mechanical design using Fusion 360, simulation with Webots, and LiDAR data processing.

This portfolio is both a professional presentation tool and a personal project that reflects my passion for intelligent and interactive systems.
